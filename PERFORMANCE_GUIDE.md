# Performance Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Speed Improvements Implemented

The triggerbot has been optimized to address slow response times while maintaining stealth capabilities.

### ⚡ Key Optimizations:

1. **Reduced Base Timing**
   - Base reaction time: `80ms` → `25ms`
   - Timing variance: `±25ms` → `±15ms`
   - Fatigue chance: `8%` → `2%`

2. **Faster Input Processing**
   - Input delay: `100-800μs` → `50-200μs`
   - Mouse hold time: `8-25ms` → `5-15ms`
   - Detection loop: `1-3ms` → `500μs`

3. **Optimized Detection Logic**
   - Miss chance: `3%` → `1%`
   - Burst fire chance: `12%` → `18%`
   - Anti-pattern delay: `5%` → `2%`

### 🎮 New Fast Mode Feature

Press **F5** to toggle Fast Mode for maximum responsiveness:

- **Fast Mode ON**: Ultra-fast response (~3ms total delay)
- **Fast Mode OFF**: Balanced stealth/speed (~25ms base)

### ⚖️ Speed vs Stealth Trade-offs

| Mode | Speed | Stealth Level | Use Case |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Standard | Fast | Low | Training/Testing |
| Stealth | Medium | High | Competitive Play |
| Fast Mode | Ultra-Fast | Medium | Reaction Training |

### 🎯 Performance Tips

1. **Use Fast Mode (F5)** when you need maximum speed
2. **Adjust detection radius** smaller for faster processing
3. **Configure enemy colors** precisely to reduce false positives
4. **Monitor CPU usage** - lower detection radius if needed

### 🔧 Manual Tuning

For custom timing profiles, use menu option 4:
- Base delay: 15-30ms for fast response
- Variance: 5-15ms for consistency
- Spread: 1.0-1.2 for natural feel
- Fatigue: 0.01-0.05 for minimal delays

### 📊 Expected Performance

- **Detection Check Rate**: ~2000 Hz (0.5ms intervals)
- **Response Time**: 25-40ms (stealth) / 3-5ms (fast mode)
- **CPU Usage**: <1% on modern systems
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB

Press F5 during runtime to toggle between stealth and fast modes!
