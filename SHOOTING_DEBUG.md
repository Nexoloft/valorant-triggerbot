# Shooting Issue Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔫 Problem: Enemy Detected But Not Shooting

### 🔍 **Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Enable Debug Mode (F6)** - Shows detailed information about what's happening
2. **Enable Test Mode (F8)** - Bypasses all delays for instant shooting
3. **Check Console Output** - Shows why shots might be blocked

### 🛠️ **New Debug Features Added:**

#### **F8 - Test Mode** ⚡
- **Purpose**: Instant shooting with zero delays
- **Bypasses**: All stealth features, human timing, burst logic
- **Output**: Shows "TEST SHOT FIRED!" when shooting
- **Use**: To verify basic shooting functionality works

#### **Enhanced Debug Output** 📊
- Shows when `shoot()` function is called
- Displays timing information and delay reasons
- Tracks if shots are blocked and why

### 🔍 **Common Shooting Blockers:**

1. **Human Delay Timing** (25ms base + variance)
   - May prevent rapid firing
   - Debug shows: "Shot blocked by human delay timing"

2. **Shot Skipping** (1% chance)
   - Random miss simulation
   - Debug shows: "Shot skipped due to human imperfection"

3. **Burst Fire Logic** 
   - May affect timing patterns
   - Debug shows: "Burst fire mode active"

4. **Triggerbot Not Active**
   - Press F1 to enable
   - Debug shows: "Triggerbot inactive"

### 🧪 **Testing Procedure:**

1. **Start the triggerbot**
2. **Press F1** to activate
3. **Press F6** for debug mode
4. **Press F8** for test mode (bypasses all delays)
5. **Aim at purple enemies** and check console output

### 📋 **Expected Debug Output:**

```
Enemy in crosshair - calling shoot()!
SHOOT() called - stealthMode:1 fastMode:0 testMode:1
TEST MODE: Instant shot!
TEST SHOT FIRED! (Total: 1)
```

### 🔧 **If Test Mode Works:**

The issue is in the stealth timing logic. Try:
- **F5**: Enable fast mode for minimal delays
- **F3**: Disable stealth mode entirely

### 🔧 **If Test Mode Doesn't Work:**

The issue is more fundamental:
- Check if F1 was pressed to activate
- Verify game is in focus
- Check Windows permissions

### 🎮 **All Controls:**

- **F1**: Toggle triggerbot on/off ⚡
- **F2**: Exit program
- **F3**: Toggle stealth mode
- **F4**: Break simulation
- **F5**: Fast mode (minimal delays)
- **F6**: Debug mode (detailed info)
- **F7**: Color sampling
- **F8**: Test mode (instant shooting) 🎯

Use **F8 Test Mode** first to verify basic functionality!
