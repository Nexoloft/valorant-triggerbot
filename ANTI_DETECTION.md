# Advanced Anti-Detection Features

## Overview

This enhanced version of the educational triggerbot includes sophisticated anti-detection techniques designed to demonstrate modern evasion methods used by advanced software. These features are implemented for educational purposes to understand how anti-cheat systems work and how malicious software attempts to evade detection.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER

These anti-detection techniques are implemented **PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES**. Using these methods to circumvent anti-cheat systems in online games violates terms of service and may be illegal in your jurisdiction. This code should only be used:

- In your own custom games
- For educational research
- To understand anti-cheat mechanisms
- With explicit permission from game developers

**DO NOT USE** in competitive online games or any environment where it violates terms of service.

## Implemented Anti-Detection Techniques

### 1. Human-Like Behavior Simulation

#### Natural Timing Patterns
- **Gamma Distribution Delays**: Uses realistic human reaction time distribution
- **Variable Timing**: Random variance in all actions to avoid predictable patterns
- **Fatigue Simulation**: Occasional longer delays to simulate human tiredness
- **Micro-hesitations**: Small random delays to mimic human uncertainty

#### Human Imperfection Simulation
- **Shot Skipping**: Occasionally misses shots (humans aren't perfect)
- **Aim Drift**: Slight random movement to simulate natural hand tremor
- **Burst Fire Patterns**: Realistic firing patterns instead of constant clicking
- **Break Simulation**: Automatic breaks to simulate human rest periods

### 2. Input Method Obfuscation

#### Multiple Input Methods
- **SendInput API**: Uses Windows SendInput instead of mouse_event
- **Variable Hold Times**: Different mouse button hold durations
- **Hardware-like Timing**: Microsecond delays to simulate actual hardware

#### Pattern Breaking
- **Method Rotation**: Rotates between different pixel reading methods
- **Anti-Pattern Delays**: Random delays to break detectable patterns
- **Decoy Operations**: Performs fake operations to confuse monitoring

### 3. Detection Evasion (Placeholder)

The `antidetection.h` file includes advanced techniques that would be used in real malware:

#### Process Detection
- **Debugger Detection**: Multiple methods to detect if being debugged
- **VM Detection**: Identifies virtual machines and sandboxes
- **Analysis Tool Detection**: Detects reverse engineering tools
- **Timing Attack Detection**: Identifies when code execution is being monitored

#### Memory Protection
- **Code Obfuscation**: XOR encryption of sensitive code sections
- **Thread Hiding**: Hides threads from debuggers
- **Anti-Dumping**: Protects against memory dumping

#### System Evasion
- **Direct Syscalls**: Bypasses API hooking by calling NT functions directly
- **Process Hollowing**: Could inject into legitimate processes
- **Hardware Breakpoint Detection**: Detects hardware-level debugging

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Stealth Configuration
- **F3 Key**: Toggle stealth mode on/off during runtime
- **F4 Key**: Manual break simulation
- **Adaptive Timing**: Changes behavior based on usage patterns
- **Session Statistics**: Tracks usage for realistic patterns

#### Multi-Method Pixel Reading
```cpp
// Rotates between different methods to avoid API monitoring
switch (methodCounter) {
    case 0: GetPixel()          // Standard method
    case 1: BitBlt()            // Alternative method
    case 2: GetDIBits()         // Advanced method
}
```

#### Sophisticated Timing
```cpp
// Gamma distribution for realistic reaction times
std::gamma_distribution<double> reaction(2.0, baseDelay / 2.0);
double delay = reaction(gen) * reactionSpread;
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings
- `delay`: Base delay for non-stealth mode
- `detectionRadius`: Pixel detection area
- `stealthMode`: Enable/disable stealth features

### Human Timing Profile
- `humanTimingBase`: Base human reaction time (50-150ms)
- `humanTimingVariance`: Random variance (±10-50ms)
- `humanTimingSpread`: Reaction spread multiplier (1.0-2.0x)
- `humanTimingFatigue`: Chance of fatigue delays (0.01-0.2)

### Advanced Features
- **Break Simulation**: Automatic human-like breaks
- **Shot Patterns**: Realistic firing behavior
- **Jitter Simulation**: Natural mouse movement imperfection

## How Anti-Cheat Systems Work

Understanding these systems helps explain why anti-detection is complex:

### Behavioral Analysis
- **Timing Analysis**: Monitors for inhuman reaction times
- **Pattern Detection**: Looks for repetitive or mechanical behavior
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzes gameplay statistics for anomalies

### Technical Detection
- **API Hooking**: Monitors system API calls
- **Memory Scanning**: Scans process memory for known signatures
- **Driver-Level Monitoring**: Kernel-level protection (like Vanguard)
- **Hardware Monitoring**: Monitors hardware-level events

### Modern Techniques
- **Machine Learning**: AI-based detection of suspicious patterns
- **Cloud Analysis**: Server-side behavioral analysis
- **Heuristic Detection**: Rules-based suspicious behavior detection

## Educational Value

This implementation demonstrates:

1. **Software Engineering**: Complex state management and timing systems
2. **Windows Programming**: Advanced Windows API usage
3. **Statistics**: Probability distributions and random number generation
4. **Security Research**: Understanding detection and evasion techniques
5. **Ethics in Computing**: Importance of responsible disclosure and ethical use

## Technical Implementation Details

### Stealth Timing System
```cpp
class StealthUtils {
    static int GenerateHumanDelay(const TimingProfile& profile);
    static bool ShouldSkipShot(double skipChance);
    static void SimulateAimDrift(int& x, int& y, int maxDrift);
    static bool ShouldBurstFire(double burstChance, int& burstCount);
};
```

### Anti-Detection Checks
```cpp
class AntiDetection {
    static bool IsBeingDebugged();      // Multiple debugger detection methods
    static bool IsRunningInVM();        // Virtual machine detection
    static bool IsBeingAnalyzed();      // Analysis tool detection
    static bool DetectTimingAttack();   // Performance monitoring detection
};
```

## Building and Compilation

To compile with anti-detection features:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -pedantic main.cpp -o bin/triggerbot.exe -lgdi32 -luser32 -lws2_32
```

Note: Some anti-detection features require additional Windows libraries.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover vulnerabilities in anti-cheat systems through this educational tool:

1. **Do NOT exploit** vulnerabilities in live games
2. **Contact developers** through responsible disclosure channels
3. **Document findings** for educational purposes
4. **Share knowledge** with the security research community
